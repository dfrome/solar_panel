Solar panel production study  
Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the profitability of solar panels over time. Based on our financial model, the break-even point is reached after nine years of operation. However, this projection assumes that the panels do not lose more than 5% of their production capacity per year.  
To validate this assumption, we must determine the actual degradation rate, particularly at the beginning of the second year of installation. This will help assess whether the panels maintain sufficient efficiency to justify the investment.
